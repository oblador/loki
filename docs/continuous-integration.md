title: Continuous Integration

Loki is built with the intention of running on a continuous integration server, ensuring you don't get any visual regressions in your project. How you run loki on a CI might be different from running locally though. The typical setup will fail stories with missing reference images by passing the `--requireReference` flag and since the CI won't change any of the underlying code, there's no need running storybook in server mode.

A command combining these two could look something like this:

```
build-storybook && loki --requireReference --reactUri file:./storybook-static
```

See the [loki react example project](https://github.com/oblador/loki/tree/master/examples/react) for a reference implementation of this approach.
